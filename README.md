**Frontend Developer with 10+ years of experience, focused on Vue / Nuxt applications with strong attention to UX, code readability, and long-term maintainability.**
I build clean, well-structured interfaces, document architectural decisions, and care about predictable behavior, scalability, and developer experience. I’ve worked on long-lived projects where code quality, documentation, and maintainability matter more than quick wins.
